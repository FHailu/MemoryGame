# MemoryGame
Memory is a classic game consisting of matching pairs of cards. The cards are shuffled and laid out in a random array. The players take turns flipping 
over pairs of cards to find matches while trying to memorize the placement. This digital version of memory enables a user to play without an opponent or 
deal with the hassle of shuffling, flipping, or laying out cards. The random array generator in the game allows the player to play over and over again 
with new orders each time. The timer feature encourages the user to continue to play to beat their time.
